# Pythiger
Compiler for the Tiger programming language implemented in Python. Based on the books by [Andrew Appel](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/c/).

All source code can be found in `src`:
* `lexer`: Chapter 2, Lexical Analysis.
* `parser`: Chapter 3, Parsing and Chapter 4, Abstract Syntax.
* `semantic_analysis`: Chapter 5, Semantic Analysis.
* `activation_records`: Chapter 6, Activation Records.
* `intermediate_representation`: Chapter 7, Translation to Intermediate Code.
* `canonical`: Chapter 8, Basic Blocks and Traces.
* `instruction_selection`: Chapter 9, Instruction Selection.
* `liveness_analysis`: Chapter 10, Liveness Analysis.
* `register_allocation`: Chapter 11, Register Allocation.
* `putting_it_all_together`: Chapter 12, Putting it All Together.
* `examples`: A list of Tiger programs provided by [Appel](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/testcases/).
* `tests`: `*** Work in Progress ***`
* `ply`: [Python Lex-Yacc](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/). Used in chapters 2-4.

## Setup
This project uses Python version `3.6`.

From the project root directory, on a [virtual Python environment](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (or not, if you're feeling brave) run:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Make sure `src/compile.sh` has execution permissions. From the `src` directory run: 
```bash
./compile.sh source_file
```
This will generate an executable in the `src` with the name `a.out`.


## Tests
